# Training School


## *Digital tools for the identification of textual practices of comparing. An introduction to annotation and operationalisation with [CATMA](https://catma.de).*
April 22nd, 2023


### Instructor: Mareike Schumacher, Ph.D.

### Info:

Annotation is a core cultural and research practice that has been practised non-digitally for a very long time before being transferred to the digital in the context of the Digital Humanities. Text markup and enrichment, free-text annotation, and taxonomy-based annotation are forms of annotation that overlap to some extent. All of these forms are digitally supported by [**CATMA**](https://catma.de). CATMA (Gius et al. 2022) is a **web-based collaborative text annotation and analysis platform** that has been in development since 2008. With the release of CATMA 6 in 2019, a Git-based backend was introduced for the platform. GitMA builds on top of that to facilitate access to and further processing of annotation data.
 
In this workshop, we will focus on **operationalisation and annotation practices**. Using the **analysis of comparisons** in literary texts as an example task, we will set up a project, develop annotation categories, and annotate and analyse a corpus. We will introduce the **basic features of CATMA as well as work on conceptualising how comparisons in (literary) texts are characterised**. With GitMA annotation data of multiple users can be compared and an Inter-Annotator-Agreement can be calculated. Further GitMA provides more elaborated visualisation methods such as network visualisations. Finally, GitMA supports the export of annotation data for further processing with other tools and practices, such as machine learning.
The introduction to GitMA will thus round off this workshop by providing you with core competencies of digital annotation from conceptual aspects to hands-on annotation in CATMA and to further use of your annotation data.

Mareike Schumacher coordinates the DFG project [forTEXT](https://fortext.net), in which, in addition to the dissemination of digital routines, resources and tools to the more traditional disciplines, the further development of CATMA plays an essential role. She received her PhD in German literature from the University of Hamburg with a thesis on “Place and Space in the Novel. A contribution to Computational Literary Studies”. Her research focus lies on distant reading methods (including named entity recognition or stylometry), digital humanities theory, and the connection between digital methods and theory-based literary and cultural studies research.
